- **RecyclerView**: Displays a list of notes showing the title and a preview of the content.
- **Button**: A simple "New Note" allows users to create a new note.
- **LayoutManager**: The app uses a `LinearLayoutManager` to display the notes in a vertical list.

### 2. Note Editor Screen

- **Cancel Button**: A button to return to the previous screen without saving the note.
- **EditText for Title**: Users can enter the title of the note.
- **Multi-line EditText for Content**: A larger EditText field for entering the note content.
